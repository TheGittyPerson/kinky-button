# Contributing to this project

## Hello!

Thanks for considering contributing to my small project.

Here, I will explain how you can help contribute to this project, what I look 
for, and how to report bugs or suggest improvements.

## Contributions You Can Make

There are many ways you can contribute: submitting suggestions or bug 
reports, improving documentation, or writing some code yourself! I'm 
guessing not many people will come across this, so even the smallest 
contributions, even typos, would be much appreciated.

I'm primarily looking for any ideas on how to make this project more fun and 
_kinky_, if you will. Any addition to the project will be, again, very much 
appreciated.

### Steps

1. Create a fork of 
   [the repository](https://github.com/TheGittyPerson/kinky-button)
2. If required, clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. Create a new branch with a meaningful name
4. Make and commit any changes made
5. Push commits to GitHub (if you have made changes locally on your machine)
6. Submit your changes for review; commit & pull request

You should receive a notification/email once your changes have been merged 
onto the main branch of this project.

### Making Your First Contribution

If you're new here or are not familiar with contributing to repositories on 
GitHub, 
[here's a repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions?tab=readme-ov-file) 
with information that might help.

## Reporting a Bug

To report a bug or issue:
1. On the repository on GitHub, go to the 
   "[Issues](https://github.com/TheGittyPerson/kinky-button/issues)" tab.
2. Select "New issue"
3. This is a tiny project, and I don't really have rules on how you should 
   write an issue report. Just include a descriptive title and helpful 
   information in the descriptions.
4. Submit the issue.

## Suggesting a Feature

If you do not which to code any features yourself, feel free to either open 
issue as described above, mentioning and explaining the new feature you 
would like to see, or add a comment under this general-purpose 
[Discussion](https://github.com/TheGittyPerson/kinky-button/discussions/1).
